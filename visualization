**The visualization produced by Palladio** ![](http://blogs.ubc.ca/szhang/files/2018/08/palladio-animated.gif) This graph was born out of my interest in studying at the granular level of _village_, which I believe served as a closely-knit clan or social unit, to examine migration patterns. Each number represents an origin village in China where immigrants were from, while the immigrantsâ€™ destinations are spelled (with darker shade). Wherever a village node is connected to a destination node, it means there were immigrants originating from the village in China who chose that destination in Canada. <br />
