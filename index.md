This tutorial [From Hermeneutics to Data to Networks: Data Extraction and Network Visualization of Historical Sources](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources) by Marten Düring on Programming Historian served as a great inspiration for me in exploring [Palladio](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/), a network analysis tool, and exploiting this tool to analyze a historical dataset for studying migration patterns. Nevertheless, when I drilled in the visualization produced by Palladio based off on my data, I found myself perplexed at some deceptively obvious characteristics of the graph, such as the nodes’ size and the connections, and their relationships. Once I tackled these puzzles, I got an entirely new understanding of the graph, which interestingly led to more research questions that can be asked of the graph. At the core, since the data I used is, by its nature, very different from extracting data from textual sources as shown in Marten Düring’s tutorial, the underlying concepts, and potential caveats-ones I discovered important to interpreting the visualization-were not covered in Marten Düring’s tutorial. What’s more, considering Palladio is a software still in its infancy, there aren’t many tutorials out there at all. Therefore I think uncovering these hidden concepts would ease researchers into experimenting with Palladio, a very-easy-to-use tool and therefore perfect for newcomers to network analysis. <br />
